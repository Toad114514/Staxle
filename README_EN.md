# Description
This is a scripting tool for those who are new to Termux and those who don't want to type commands, and provides a variety of services that can be run in Termux to install and configure<br>
It's like a repository like [Lazymux](https://github.com/Gameye98/Lazymux) but the goal of Staxle's script is to assemble and configure all kinds of services in termux, and only one script can be fully or semi-automatically installed and configured for most of the desired services<br>
Since I am a beginner in Python, if there are any bugs, you can report them to the issues
